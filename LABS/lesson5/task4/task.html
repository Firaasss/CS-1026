In this task you must write a function that takes a number and checks to see if 7 is a multiple of it.
It will return the number if it is, otherwise it will return -1.
For example, 6 is not a multiple of 7, 7 is a multiple of 7 as well as 14,21,...
Thus if you ran your function on 14 it will return 14. If you ran it on 6 it will return -1<br><br>
We have created a function for you that will check your function for all numbers between 0-100 not inclusive.
