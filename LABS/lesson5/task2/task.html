The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by each of it's predecessors until you reach 0.<br>
For example 3!(read as 3 factorial) is 3x2x1 = 6.<br>
5! is 5x4x3x2x1 = 120<br><br>
You are to complete the definition of a function that computes the factorial of a given number.<br><br>
We have given you a small program that tries to call a function called factorial for the numbers 5,7, and 9.
