We will  now write a small program to do the opposite of the previous task.<br><br>

This program will take a fahrenheit value from a user and convert it to celsius.<br><br>

The formula to do this conversion is C = (F-32) * 5/9; you will need to express this as a
Python expression.<br><br>

When finished try it with 86 Fahrenheit it should output 30.0 Celsius.
