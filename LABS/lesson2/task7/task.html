Let's write a small program to take input from the keyboard and use it to convert celsius to fahrenheit.<br><br>

We can use the input function to gather input from the keyboard and store it in a variable.
The string we pass to the input function is the prompt displayed to the user.<br><br>

Make sure you store it as the proper value type or convert it after you take the input
otherwise it may not work.<br><br>

Fix the print statement to continue.
