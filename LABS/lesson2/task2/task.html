Let's take a look at some boolean expressions.<br><br>
Python has boolean expressions just like you would use in math.<br><br>

The standard ones are:<br>
> (greater than),<br>
&lt; (less than), <br>
&lt;= (less than or equal to),<br>
>= (greater than or equal to),<br>
== (equal (note the 2 equal signs!),<br>
!= (not equal).<br><br>

Add your own line after the ones listed to try some yourself.
