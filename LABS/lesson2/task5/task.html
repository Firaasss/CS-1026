Let's take a look at how we assign values to variables.<br><br>

Remember the left hand side of the assignment operator is what is<br>
receiving the value (the variable) and the right hand side is what is giving the value.<br><br>

You can reuse and reassign variables after you have declared them at least once.<br><br>

Try at least one of your own examples before continuing.
