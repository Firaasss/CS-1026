To familiarize yourself with boolean expressions, fix the following expressions
by changing the '?'s so that each of the print statements prints out True.<br><br>

Recall that in Python the operators for AND, OR and NOT are the keywords 'and' 'or' and 'not'.<br><br>

That is to say... if you wanted to check 'if a and b' were true and do something if
they were True, you would write:<br>and
if a and b:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp do something
