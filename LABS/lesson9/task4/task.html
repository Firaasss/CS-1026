Let's take a look at looping through dictionaries.<br><br>

In this task we give you 2 lists: name and alias.
Make a dictionary using these two lists.  Store name as the key and alias as the value.
They are ordered correctly for you.<br><br>

Loop through a sorted version of that dictionary.
Print out the name, followed by a space, followed by a colon, followed by a space,
then finally the alias.<br>
Eg. Stirling : Duchess<br>
