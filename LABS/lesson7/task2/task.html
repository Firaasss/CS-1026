In this task, we give you a file called text.txt, we also open a new file for you
called myfile.txt.<br><br>
There is only one line in text.txt.  The program should read this line and split it<br>
into individual words; these words should be written to the screen and to the<br>
file myfile.txt with each word on its own line.<br><br>
Hint: a similar example was done in the lecture notes for you.<br>
