In this lab we will focus on reading and writing from files.<br><br>
For the first task, open the file text.txt and print out each line.
For example, if the file contains 3 lines and line 1 is 'a', line 2 is 'b' and line 3 is 'c' your
program should print the following out:<br>
a<br>
b<br>
c<br><br>
Be sure to use print with 'end = ""' as there are already new line characters. You can also strip the new line
as was shown in class.
