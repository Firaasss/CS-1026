In this task we give you a list of strings. You are to write a function called lenWords that returns
a list of the lengths of each of the words in the list in order.<br><br>
So if the list we gave you was  lista=["pool","hammer"] the list your function should
return would consist of the values 4 and 6 in that order, i.e. a list [4,6].<br><br>
